# CityFlow

CityFlow is a versatile tool that allows users to design, evaluate, and visualize urban solutions through an llm-integrated, case-based system. Leveraging Python and JavaScript modules, CityFlow empowers urban analysts, city planners, and researchers to address real-world city challenges by creating customized workflows for urban problem-solving.

### A Low-code Tool for Urban Analyst

CityFlow provides a low-code environment that enables urban analysts to develop and test city models with minimal coding effort.

### An Open Platform for Urban Scientists

CityFlow integrates AI-powered search engines into urban workflows, creating a platform that fosters collaboration among experts, city planners, and urban scientists. It enables users to search for and share research findings, workflows, and case studies, contributing to a continuously evolving database of urban design solutions. By facilitating the exchange of knowledge and best practices, CityFlow drives innovation in urban development, making it easier to replicate or adapt successful approaches for more effective city planning and management.
